# Hey. Hi. Hello.
The project was proposed by Prof. Chotipat Pornavalai as the subject of Problem Solving in Information Technology (PSIT) at King Mongkut Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

We teamed up with 4 freshman colleges to analyze the data for the analytical purpose.

The initial ideas was to visualizes the data of 2015's national car registrations in the Kingdom of Thailand. Also to analytics using correlations to support our theories.

As me, sagelga, the repository owner. I will kept this repository in Public. Forever.

# Purpose
The project was meant to be teaching in Python 3.5.x and modules usages.

But to this project, the data will visualizes others what we have found in that small bit of information.

# How to use
You can just look and see what's happened inside the codes.

The analyzed data will be formed inside the individual python files.

# Redistribution
We are happy to find you on playing along to this repository. Felt free to clone our repository.

If you want to clone the files, type as following.

```
git clone https://github.com/sagelga/PSIT_Project.git
```

You're welcome! Be sure to star out project, that will cheers us up.
