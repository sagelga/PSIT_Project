# Hey. Hi. Hello.
The project was proposed by Prof. Chotipat Pornavalai in the subject of Problem Solving in Information Technology.

We teamed up with 4 students from the same subject to do analyze the data for the analytical purpose.

The initial ideas was to give the data of Thailand's 2015 car registrations for a graph that visualizes the amount.

Also to analytics why it happened (why it is by that number) by using external data to support our theories.

As me, sagelga, the repository owner. I will kept this repository in Public, because why not?

Just Kidding, I just want to show how the data analytics and python goes together as one. Unite!

# Purpose
The project was meant to be teaching in Python 3.x and other modules.

But to this project, it will teach us how to analyze the data and give that power to increase Thailand's government productivity.

# How to use
You can just look and see what's happened inside the codes.

The analyzed data will be formed inside the individual python files.

# Redistribution
We are happy to find you on playing along to this repository.

If you want to clone the files, type as following.

```
git clone https://github.com/sagelga/PSIT_Project.git
```

You're welcome!
